# Module 4 Homework: Analytics Engineering with dbt

In this homework, we'll use the dbt project in `04-analytics-engineering/taxi_rides_ny/` to transform NYC taxi data and answer questions by querying the models.

## Setup

1. Set up your dbt project following the [setup guide](../../../04-analytics-engineering/setup/)
2. Load the Green and Yellow taxi data for 2019-2020 and FHV trip data for 2019 into your warehouse (use static tables from [dtc github](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/), don't use offical tables from tlc because some values change from time to time)
3. Run `dbt build --target prod` to create all models and run tests

> **Note:** By default, dbt uses the `dev` target. You must use `--target prod` to build the models in the production dataset, which is required for the homework queries below.

After a successful build, you should have models like `fct_trips`, `dim_zones`, and `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` in your warehouse.

---

### Question 1. dbt Lineage and Execution

Given a dbt project with the following structure:

```
models/
├── staging/
│   ├── stg_green_tripdata.sql
│   └── stg_yellow_tripdata.sql
└── intermediate/
    └── int_trips_unioned.sql (depends on stg_green_tripdata & stg_yellow_tripdata)
```

If you run `dbt run --select int_trips_unioned`, what models will be built?

- `stg_green_tripdata`, `stg_yellow_tripdata`, and `int_trips_unioned` (upstream dependencies)
- Any model with upstream and downstream dependencies to `int_trips_unioned`
- `int_trips_unioned` only ✅
- `int_trips_unioned`, `int_trips`, and `fct_trips` (downstream dependencies)

**Explanation:**
- The `--select` flag without modifiers selects only the specified model
- To include upstream dependencies, you'd use `--select +int_trips_unioned`
- To include downstream dependencies, you'd use `--select int_trips_unioned+`
- To include both upstream and downstream, you'd use `--select +int_trips_unioned+`
---

### Question 2. dbt Tests

You've configured a generic test like this in your `schema.yml`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: payment_type
    data_tests:
      - accepted_values:
          arguments:
            values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            quote: false
```

Your model `fct_trips` has been running successfully for months. A new value `6` now appears in the source data.

What happens when you run `dbt test --select fct_trips`?

- dbt will skip the test because the model didn't change
- dbt will fail the test, returning a non-zero exit code ✅
- dbt will pass the test with a warning about the new value
- dbt will update the configuration to include the new value

**Explanation:**
- The `accepted_values` test checks that all values in the column are in the specified list
- When a value (6) appears that's not in the accepted list [1,2,3,4,5], the test fails
- dbt returns exit code 1, indicating test failure
- To make it pass with a warning instead, you can set `severity: warn` in the test configuration

### Question 3. Counting Records in `fct_monthly_zone_revenue`

After running your dbt project, query the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model.

What is the count of records in the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` model?

- 12,998
- 14,120
- 12,184 ✅
- 15,421

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `dtc-de-course-487612.dbt_prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`;
```
---

### Question 4. Best Performing Zone for Green Taxis (2020)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, find the pickup zone with the **highest total revenue** (`revenue_monthly_total_amount`) for **Green** taxi trips in 2020.

Which zone had the highest revenue?

- East Harlem North ✅
- Morningside Heights
- East Harlem South
- Washington Heights South

```sql
SELECT
  pickup_zone,
  SUM(revenue_monthly_total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM
  `dtc-de-course-487612.dbt_prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE
  service_type = 'Green'
  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM revenue_month) = 2020
GROUP BY
  pickup_zone
ORDER BY
  total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
---

### Question 5. Green Taxi Trip Counts (October 2019)

Using the `fct_monthly_zone_revenue` table, what is the **total number of trips** (`total_monthly_trips`) for Green taxis in October 2019?

- 500,234
- 350,891
- 384,624 ✅
- 421,509

```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(total_monthly_trips) AS total_trip
FROM 
     `dtc-de-course-487612.dbt_prod.fct_monthly_zone_revenue`
WHERE 
    service_type = 'Green' 
    AND revenue_month = '2019-10-01';
```
---

### Question 6. Build a Staging Model for FHV Data

Create a staging model for the **For-Hire Vehicle (FHV)** trip data for 2019.

1. Load the [FHV trip data for 2019](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/tag/fhv) into your data warehouse
2. Create a staging model `stg_fhv_tripdata` with these requirements:
   - Filter out records where `dispatching_base_num IS NULL`
   - Rename fields to match your project's naming conventions (e.g., `PUlocationID` → `pickup_location_id`)

What is the count of records in `stg_fhv_tripdata`?

- 42,084,899
- 43,244,693 ✅
- 22,998,722
- 44,112,187

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `dtc-de-course-487612.dbt_prod.stg_fhv_tripdata`;
```
